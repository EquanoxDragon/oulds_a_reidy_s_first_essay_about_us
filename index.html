	<h1>Hi! my name is Alexis</h1>

	<h2>A little bit about me</h2>
	<p>I'm 19 years old and have lived in Ontario Canada my entire life. I have anxiety and ADHD as well as being on the Autism Spectrum. Because of these I tend to react and learn differently from most people. This also tends to make me a litte slow with some things. I love playing video games, writing stories, making art, and dragons!</p>
